# Poski

Poski is an Android application that I developed for our group in "Ammatillisesti Suuntaava Projekti" course.
We used Lego Mindstorms robots with NXT Intelligent Bricks in the project.

(I have replaced the original audio files and launcher icon)

Using leJOS with Android:

## Installation and usage

If you want to use or check out the code, you can download the whole project and open it in Android Studio.
This application is based on an old LeJOS Android sample code, and may thus not work with Lego robots anymore


## License
